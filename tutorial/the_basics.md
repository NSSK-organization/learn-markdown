# The Basics

In this tutorial, we will learn the basics of markdown.

## Code

There are two forms of code: `in-line code` and code blocks. To create in-line code, surround the text you would like to code-ify with one (1) grave accent/backtick (\`).

## Headers

Headers are simple in markdown. To create a header, simply put a hashtag (#) before the word.

```
# This text would be a header (if it weren't in a code block).
```
