# Learning markdown

A simple markdown tutorial.

# Why learn markdown?

Markdown is a simple langauge to learn. Here are several reasons to learn markdown:

* Create documentation: You can create markdown on various places, like GitHub
* Alternative to HTML: Instead of using HTML, you can use markdown with a framework like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
* Easy to learn: Markdown is simple, with very few things to learn.

# Quickstart Guide

## Using Git (MacOS and Linux)

To create and edit this repo locally (on your computer), type the following into your command line/terminal:

```
cd ~
mkdir learn-markdown
cd learn-markdown
git init
git clone https://github.com/NSSK-organization/learn-markdown.git
```
To confirm you have succesfully cloned the repo, type

```
ls
```

If you see the names of several files (including one named README.md) you should be good to go! All you need is a markdown editor (there are lots of good ones for Linux and MacOS) and/or a text editor. Start [here](/tutorial/the_basics.md).

## Using GitHub (Windows, Chromebook, MacOS, Linux)

GitHub comes with a pretty sweet markdown editor already built into it, so if you prefer, you can edit directly from there. Just make a fork of the repository and learn away! Start [here](https://github.com/NSSK-organization/learn-markdown/blob/main/tutorial/the_basics.md).
